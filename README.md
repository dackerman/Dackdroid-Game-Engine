DACKDROID Game Engine
=====================

Description
-----------
This is the 2D Game Engine I am building to use with my own 2D Games on 
Android.  Right now, although you can see all the source, I am *NOT* allowing it
to be used freely.  The reason is two fold:

1. I don't want people to think it is "working" yet, so I am not yet soliciting critiques.
2. There is nothing special for now, so I don't care if people see the source code.

Conclusion
----------
If it gets really awesome and I think it is useful for other projects, then I may open
source it, or put some other license on it.

Thanks for understanding!
